Dear NeCTAR Research Cloud User,

    </p>

    <p>
We have determined that one of your NeCTAR Research Cloud instances running at
{{ server.zone }} is affected by the recent heartbleed OpenSSL vulnerability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='bold'>AFFECTED INSTANCE:</span>
    </p>

    <table class='noborder'>
      <tr><th>UUID</th><th>IP Address:Port</th><th>Host</th><th>Project</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>{{ server.id }}</td>
        <td>{{ server.accessIPv4 }}:{{ server.port }}</td>
        <td>{{ server.name }}</td>
        <td>{{ server.project }}</td>

      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
We strongly advise you to take the following actions for each affected instance:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
Upgrade OpenSSL to latest version and restart all services. A reboot will restart all services.
      </li>
      <li>
If you use SSL certificates, request the revocation of your current certificates and replace them.
      </li>
      <li>
Reset any OS or application passwords, as these may have been leaked.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
You can use http://filippo.io/Heartbleed to test if your instance is still vulnerable after completing the above steps.
    </p>

    <p>
Please see http://heartbleed.com for further information about this vulnerability.
