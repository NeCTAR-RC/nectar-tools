We have determined that one of your NeCTAR Research Cloud instances running at

AFFECTED INSTANCE:

IP Address:Port: {{ server.accessIPv4 }}:{{ server.port }}
HOST: {{ server.name }}
PROJECT: {{ server.project }}

We strongly advise you to take the following actions for each affected instance:

* Upgrade OpenSSL to latest version and restart all services. A reboot after
  upgrading will restart all services.

* If you use SSL certificates, request the revocation of your current
  certificates and replace them.

* Reset any OS or application passwords, as these may have been leaked.

You can use http://filippo.io/Heartbleed to test if your instance is still
