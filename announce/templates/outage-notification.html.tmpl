Dear NeCTAR Research Cloud User,
    </p>

    <p>
This email is to inform you of a scheduled outage to the NeCTAR Research Cloud.
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr><td><span class='bold'>DURATION:</span></td><td>{{ days }} day{% if days > 1 %}s{% endif %} {{ hours }} hours</td></tr>
      <tr><td><span class='bold'>START TIME:</span></td><td>{{ start_ts }} {{ tz }}</td></tr>
      <tr><td><span class='bold'>END TIME:</span></td><td>{{ end_ts }} {{ tz }}</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      <span class='bold'>DESCRIPTION:</span>
      <br />
A {{ days }} day{% if days > 1 %}s{% endif %} {{ hours }} hours outage is required to perform essential
maintenance on cloud infrastructure at the {{ zone }} availability zone. Only
instances in the {{ zone }} availability zone will be affected. The upgrade
will bring further stability and increased performance to this availability
zone.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class='bold'>IMPACT:</span>
      <br />
All instances in the {{ zone }} availability zone will be shut down
and will be inaccessible during the outage. Instances will NOT be destroyed,
only shut down. This zone will be offline during the outage period and no
requests to the zone will be processed. Users have the option of relocating
instances to other availability zones prior to the outage. At present there is
reasonable spare capacity across the cloud to start instances elsewhere,
however this capacity may decrease as the outage date approaches.
      <br />
      <br />

{% if affected -%}
Your current instances in the {{ zone }} zone are listed below.
      <br />
{% endif -%}

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='bold'>ACTION REQUIRED:</span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
It is recommended that users complete their own backups, snapshots or
otherwise copy data to somewhere other than the {{ zone }} zone
      </li>
      <li>
Once backups are complete, it is recommended that users detach volumes and
shut down their own instances. If a user is unable to do so, the instances
will be shut down at the outage start time
      </li>
      <li>
Ensure that the above items are completed well in advance of the outage
start time
      </li>
      <li>
After the outage, users will be required to restart their own instances
      </li>
    </ul>

{% if affected -%}
    <p>
      <span class='bold'>AFFECTED INSTANCES:</span>
    </p>

    <table class='noborder'>
      <tr><th>UUID</th><th>IP Address</th><th>Host</th><th>Project</th></tr>
  {% for project, servers in instances.iteritems() -%}
    {% for server in servers -%}
      <tr>
        <td>{{ server.id }}</td>
        <td>{{ server.accessIPv4 }}</td>
        <td>{{ server.name }}</td>
        <td>{{ project }}</td>
      </tr>
    {% endfor %}
  {% endfor %}
    </table>
{% endif -%}
