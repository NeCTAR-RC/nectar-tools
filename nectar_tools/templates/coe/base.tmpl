Subject: Action Required: Your Nectar Kubernetes Cluster Is Running an End-of-Life Version

Hi [User's Name],

We’re reaching out to let you know that your Kubernetes cluster on the Nectar Kubernetes Service is currently running a version that has reached its end of life and is no longer supported.

To ensure continued security, stability, and access to new features, you’ll need to choose one of the following options within the next 7 days:
1. Automatic Upgrade (Default)

If we don’t hear back from you within a week, we will proceed with an automatic upgrade of your cluster to a supported version. This option ensures minimal disruption and continued management of your cluster.
2. Orphan the Cluster

You may choose to orphan your cluster. This means it will no longer be managed by the Nectar Kubernetes Service, and you will be responsible for its maintenance and upgrades going forward.
3. Green-Blue Upgrade

If you prefer a more controlled upgrade process, you can opt for a green-blue upgrade. This involves provisioning a new cluster and migrating workloads over, allowing for testing and validation before decommissioning the old cluster.

Please reply to this email with your preferred option by [insert deadline date]. If we don’t receive a response, we will proceed with the automatic upgrade.

If you have any questions or need assistance with the upgrade process, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
