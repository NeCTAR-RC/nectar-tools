<p>Dear Nectar Research Cloud User,</p>
<br/>
<p>We’re contacting you regarding your Kubernetes cluster on the <strong>Nectar Kubernetes Service</strong>, which is now running a version that has reached its end of life.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Cluster Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cluster ID:</strong> {{ cluster.uuid }}</li>
  <li><strong>Cluster Name:</strong> {{ cluster.name }}</li>
  <li><strong>Project Name:</strong> {{ project.name }}</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Unfortunately, this cluster cannot be upgraded because it relies on a deprecated driver that is no longer supported. As a result, we are unable to continue managing this cluster through the Nectar Kubernetes Service.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>What this means:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>On <strong>14 October</strong>, the cluster will be <strong>orphaned</strong>, meaning it will remain running but will no longer be managed or supported by our service.</li>
  <li>You will be responsible for maintaining, upgrading, and monitoring the cluster going forward.</li>
  <li>We strongly recommend planning a migration to a new cluster using supported drivers and versions to ensure long-term stability and security.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>If you need assistance with planning a migration or have questions about your options, please don’t hesitate to reach out.</p>
<br/>
<p>Kind regards,<br/>
The ARDC Nectar Research Cloud Support Team
