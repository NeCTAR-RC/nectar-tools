Dear Nectar Research Cloud User,
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We hope that you have found the Nectar Research Cloud (NRC) helpful in your research.
<br />
<br />
Projects on the NRC are created for a fixed term to ensure fair access
to resources for all users of the cloud.
<br />
<br />
Trial projects are given a usage-based quota equivalent to running two CPU cores for three months (approximately 4000 core-hours) or a time period of 12 months if the usage-based quota is not used first.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Your trial project, {{ project.name }}, has now <b>expired</b>.
<br />
<br />
It has been 2 weeks since your project trial expired and you have not applied to convert your trial to an allocation, as previously advised our system has now stopped all instances. In 2 weeks we will terminate and archive any instances and data in this project allocation, releasing the resources for other users of the cloud. The archived instances and data will be safely stored, and will remain available to you for 3 months from the date when the project expired. However after this time they will be deleted. 
<br />
<br />
You will be able to access the archived instances and data by logging a <a href="https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/tickets/new">support ticket</a> or replying to this email.
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you wish to continue using the NRC for your research please submit an allocation request from the Nectar Research Cloud Dashboard ; see: https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000055380-resources-available-to-you
for details for requesting an allocation and additional information on Nectar Research Cloud resources.
<br />
<br />
If you do submit an allocation request to continue using the NRC, you will have the ability to transfer your resources to your new allocation. Please remember to select convert my PT when applying.
<br />
<br />
Please reply to this email if you have any questions or concerns.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,
<br />
<br />
