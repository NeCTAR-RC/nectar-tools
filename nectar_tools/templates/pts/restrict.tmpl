Dear Nectar Research Cloud User,
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We hope that you have found the Nectar Research Cloud (NRC) helpful in your research.
<br />
<br />
Projects on the NRC are created for a fixed term to ensure fair access to resources for all users of the cloud.
<br />
<br />
Trial projects are given a usage-based quota equivalent to running two CPU cores for three months (approximately 4000 core-hours) or a time period of 12 months if the usage-based quota is not used first.
<br />
<br />
Your trial project, <b>{{ project.name }}</b>, has reached 100% of allowed cloud usage or has been running for 12 months.
<br />
<br />
Our system has now set your project's quota to zero. Any instances within the project will remain active, but you won't be able to launch any new instances.
<br />
<br />
After 2 weeks, if you have not applied for project allocation, our system will stop any instances and data in this project allocation. After a further 2 weeks our system will terminate and archive any instances and data in this project trial, releasing the resources for other users of the cloud. The archived instances and data will be safely stored, and will remain available to you for 3 months from the date when the project expires. However after this time they will be deleted. 
<br />
<br />
You will be able to access the archived instances and data by logging a <a href="https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/tickets/new">support ticket</a> or replying to this email.
<br />
<br />
If you wish to continue using the NRC for your research please submit an allocation request from the Nectar Research Cloud Dashboard ; see: https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000055380-resources-available-to-you
for details for requesting an allocation and additional information on Nectar Research Cloud resources.
<br />
<br />
If you do submit an allocation request to continue using the NRC, you will have the ability to transfer your resources to your new allocation. Please remember to select convert my PT when applying.
<br />
<br />
Please reply to this email if you have any questions or concerns.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,
Nectar Research Cloud Team
