Dear Project Manager,
<br />
<br />
We hope that you have found the Nectar Research Cloud helpful in your research.
<br />
<br />
Project allocations on the Research Cloud are created for a fixed term to ensure fair access to resources for all users of the cloud.
<br />
<br />
Your project allocation, {{ project.name }}, has now <b>expired</b>.
<br />
<br />
It has been 2 weeks since your project allocation expired and you have not applied for an extension of your allocation, as previously advised our system has now stopped all instances. In 2 weeks we will terminate and archive any instances and data in this project allocation, releasing the resources for other users of the cloud. The archived instances and data will be safely stored, and will remain available to you for 3 months from the date when the project expired. However after this time they will be deleted. <b>Data that has been shared or made public on Object store will not be archived or deleted. It will remain accessible.</b>
<br />
<br />
You will be able to access the archived instances and data by logging a <a href="https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/tickets/new">support ticket</a> or replying to this email.
<br />
<br />
Thanks,
<br />
Nectar Research Cloud Team
