Hi,
<br />
<br />
Your allocation has been approved as a {{ allocation.allocation_home_display }} allocation. Upon approval of your last allocation extension request you were advised that you will only be able to use the cloud resources provided by the {{ allocation.allocation_home_display }} Nectar site and will have to move instance(s) that are running on other availability zones. It looks like you still have instance(s) that are outside your approved allocation home location.
<br />
<br />
You will need to move the instance(s) to be within the following compute availability zones available to you:
<ul>
<li>{{ compute_zones }}</li>
</ul>
Affected instance(s):
<table style="border:1px solid black;border-collapse:collapse;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">
<thead>
<th style="border:1px solid black;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">ID</th>
<th style="border:1px solid black;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">Name</th>
<th style="border:1px solid black;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">Availability Zone</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
{% for instance in out_of_zone_instances %}
<tr>
<td style="border:1px solid black;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">{{ instance.id }}</td>
<td style="border:1px solid black;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">{{ instance.name }}</td>
<td style="border:1px solid black;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">{{ instance['OS-EXT-AZ:availability_zone'] }}</td>
</tr>
{% endfor %}
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
Your instance(s) need to be moved by <b>{{ expiry_date }}</b>, after this date they will be shut down and archiving of your data will begin.

For instructions on how to move your instance(s) between availability zones please refer to our support documentation at <a href="https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000191165-migrating-instances-between-availability-zones">this link</a>.
