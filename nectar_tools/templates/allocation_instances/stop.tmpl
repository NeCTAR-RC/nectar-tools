Hi,
<br />
<br />
Your following out of zone instance(s) which are from project <b>{{ project.name }}</b>, have now been <b>disabled</b> as they have not been moved to your approved home allocation Nectar site.
<br />
<br />
Since your allocation has been approved as a {{ allocation.allocation_home_display }} allocation. You will be able to use the cloud resources provided by the {{ allocation.allocation_home_display }} Nectar site.
<br />
You can still arrange to move your instance(s) to the following compute availability zones available to you:
<ul>
<li>{{ compute_zones }}</li>
</ul>
Affected instance(s):
<table  style="border:1px solid black;border-collapse:collapse;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">
<thead>
<th style="border:1px solid black;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">ID</th>
<th style="border:1px solid black;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">Name</th>
<th style="border:1px solid black;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">Availability Zone</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
{% for instance in out_of_zone_instances %}
<tr>
<td style="border:1px solid black;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">{{ instance.id }}</td>
<td style="border:1px solid black;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">{{ instance.name }}</td>
<td style="border:1px solid black;padding:0 5px 0 5px;">{{ instance['OS-EXT-AZ:availability_zone'] }}</td>
</tr>
{% endfor %}
</tbody>
</table>
<br />

For instructions on how to move your instance(s) between availability zones please refer to our support documentation at <a href="https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000191165-migrating-instances-between-availability-zones">this link</a>.

If your instance(s) move is not completed within 2 weeks then they will be archived. The archived instance(s) and data will be safely stored, and will remain available to you for 3 months from the date when the instance(s) are archived. However, after this time they will be permanently deleted.
<br />

Kind Regards,
<br />
Nectar Research Cloud Team.
