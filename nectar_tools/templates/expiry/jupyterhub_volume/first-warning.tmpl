Dear ARDC Nectar Jupyter Notebook Service user,
<br />
<br />
We hope the Jupyter Notebook service was helpful in your research.
<br />
<br />
In order to ensure efficient use of resources, we are expiring the Jupyter
Notebook service data of users that have not used the service within the
last six months.
<br />
We have determined that this applies to your account (<b>{{ name }}</b>), and
so we plan to archive your storage on <b>{{ expiry_date }}</b>.
<br />
<br />
<b>What happens now?</b>
<br />
<br />
If you no longer require your data, then no action is required and you can
simply disregard this email.
<br />
However if you do wish to keep your data, please log in and launch a notebook
before <b>{{ expiry_date }}</b> to cancel the expiry process.
<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or concerns, please reply directly to this email or
log a <a href="https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/tickets/new">support ticket</a>.
<br />
<br />
Thanks,
<br />
ARDC Nectar Research Cloud Team
