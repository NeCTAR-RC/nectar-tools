Dear NeCTAR Research Cloud User,
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We hope that you have found the NeCTAR Research Cloud (NRC) helpful in
your research.
<br />
<br />
Please assist us to improve the user experience by completing a
<a href="https://uniofqueensland.syd1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9TD997RiPOgobGu">short questionnaire</a>
about your experience of using the NRC.
<br />
<br />
Projects on the NRC are created for a fixed term to ensure fair access
to resources for all users of the cloud.
<br />
<br />
Trial projects are given a time-based quota equivalent to running two
CPU cores for three months (approximately 4000 core-hours).
<br />
<br />
Your trial project, {{ project.name }}, has reached 120% of allowed
cloud usage.
<br />
<br />
Our system will now shut down and archive any instances in this trial
project (including suspended and stopped instances). This will release
the resources for other users of the cloud. The archived instances will
be safely stored, and will remain available to you for 3 months from the
date they were shut down.
<br />
<br />
If you wish to continue using the NRC for your research please submit an
allocation request; see:
  https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000055380-resources-available-to-you
for details on how to access further resources on the NRC.
<br />
<br />
If you are thinking of putting in an application for use of further NRC
resources, please let us know so we can help you smoothly transition
your research onto a new project allocation.
<br />
<br />
Please reply to this email if you have any questions or concerns. For further information about project trial expiry and applying for an allocation, please refer to https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000171494-project-allocation-expiry-and-renewal#pt

<br />
Thanks,
<br />
<br />
