Dear Project Manager,
<br />
<br />
We hope that you have found the Nectar Research Cloud helpful in your research.
<br />
<br />
Project allocations on the Research Cloud are created for a fixed term and with a specified Service Unit (SU) Budget to ensure fair access to resources for all cloud users.
<br />
<br />
Your project allocation, {{ project.name }}, {% if su_info.over_budget %}has now used over 100% of its allocated service unit budget {% else %}has now reached its end date {% endif %}and has now <b>expired</b>.
<br />
<b>If you wish to continue using this project allocation</b> for your research, please submit an extension request via the <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/">Nectar Dashboard</a>, by following steps <a href="https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000272526-how-to-renew-extend-your-allocation">here</a>. Please also add any publications from your research and any research grants supported by this project allocation.
<br>
Please also <b>list any publication outputs from your research and any research grants</b> supported by this project allocation. This helps us justify continuing to provide this service.
<br />
Your project allocation has now been set to zero, which means no new virtual machines or cloud storage can be used.  After 2 weeks, if you have not applied for an extension of your allocation, our system will stop any instances and data in this project allocation. After a further 2 weeks our system will terminate and archive any instances and data in this project allocation, releasing the resources for other users of the cloud. The archived instances and data will be safely stored, and will remain available to you for 3 months from the date when the project expires. However after this time they will be deleted. <b>Some resources that have been made public (for example Community images or public Object store data) will remain accessible and not be deleted.</b>
<br />
<br />
You will be able to access the archived instances and data by logging a <a href="https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/tickets/new">support ticket</a> or replying to this email.
<br />
<b>If you no longer require this allocation</b> please help us by shutting down your instances and deleting your data prior to expiry of your allocation.
<br />
<br />
Thanks,
<br />
ARDC Nectar Research Cloud Team
