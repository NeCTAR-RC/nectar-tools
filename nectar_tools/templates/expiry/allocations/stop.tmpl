Dear Project Manager,
<br />
<br />
We hope that you have found the Nectar Research Cloud helpful in your research.
<br />
<br />
Project allocations on the Research Cloud are created for a fixed term to ensure fair access to resources for all users of the cloud.
<br />
<br />
Your project allocation, {{ project.name }}, has now <b>expired</b>.
<br />
<br />
It has been 2 weeks since your project allocation expired and you have not applied for an extension of your allocation, as previously advised our system has now stopped all instances. In 2 weeks we will terminate and archive any instances and data in this project allocation, releasing the resources for other users of the cloud. The archived instances and data will be safely stored, and will remain available to you for 3 months from the date when the project expired. However after this time they will be deleted. <b>Data that has been shared or made public on Object store will not be archived or deleted. It will remain accessible.</b>
<br />
<br />
You will be able to access the archived instances and data by logging a <a href="https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/tickets/new">support ticket</a> or replying to this email.
<br />
<br />
<b>If you wish to continue using this project allocation</b> for your research please submit an extension request for your project allocation by following the steps below:
<br />
<ol>
<li>Log in to the <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au">Nectar dashboard</a></li>
<li>Navigate to "Allocations -> My Requests" and click the "Amend/Extend allocation" button on the right, next to your project.</li>
<li>On the Request Form, you are asked to fill in or adjust some details about your research project. Please review this carefully, as some questions may have changed since your previous application.</li>
<li>Click the "Submit" button.</li>
</ol>
<br />
<b>If you no longer require this allocation</b> please help us by shutting down your instances and deleting your data prior to expiry of your allocation.
