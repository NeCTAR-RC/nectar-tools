<br />
<br />
As you have not applied for an extension of your allocation yet, as previously advised our system has now stopped all instances. In 2 weeks we will terminate and archive any instances and data in this project allocation, releasing the resources for other users of the cloud. The archived instances and data will be safely stored, and will remain available to you for 3 months from the date when the project expired. After this time they will be deleted. <b>Data that has been shared or made public on Object store will not be archived or deleted. It will remain accessible.</b>
<br />
<br />
You will be able to access the archived instances and data by logging a <a href="https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/tickets/new">support ticket</a> or replying to this email.
