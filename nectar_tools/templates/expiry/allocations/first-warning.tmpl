Dear Project Manager,
<br />
<br />
We hope the Nectar Research Cloud was helpful in your research.
<br />
<br />
{% if su_info.over_80_percent %}
Your project allocation, <b>{{ project.name }}</b>, has now used over 80% of its allocated service unit budget.
{% else %}
Your project allocation, <b>{{ project.name }}</b>, is <b>due to expire on {{ expiry_date }}.</b>
{% endif %}
<br />
<br />
<b>If you wish to continue using this project allocation</b> for your research, please submit an extension request via the <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/">Nectar Dashboard</a>, by following steps <a href="https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000272526-how-to-renew-extend-your-allocation">here</a>.
<br />
<br />
Please also <b>list any publication outputs from your research and any research grants</b> supported by this project allocation. This helps us justify continuing to provide this service.
<br />
<br />
<b>If you no longer require this allocation</b> please help us by shutting down your instances and deleting your data prior to expiry of your allocation. This releases these resources to other users of the Cloud.
<br />
<br />
<b>What happens if I do not submit anything?</b>
<br />
<br />
If you have not submitted a project allocation extension request, by either the project expiry date OR when 100% of your allocated service unit budget is reached, the quota for your project allocation will be set to zero.
<br />
<br />
<i>After 2 weeks, if you have not applied for an extension of your allocation, our system will stop any instances and data in this project allocation. After a further 2 weeks our system will terminate and archive any instances and data in this project allocation, releasing the resources for other users of the cloud. The archived instances and data will be safely stored, and will remain available to you for 3 months from the date when the project expires. However after this time they will be deleted. Some resources that have been made public (for example Community images or public Object store data) will remain accessible and not be deleted.</i>
