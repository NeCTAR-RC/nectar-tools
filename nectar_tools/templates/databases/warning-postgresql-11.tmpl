{% block upgrade %}
An automatic upgrade between major version of PostgreSQL is not currently possible.
<br/>
<br/>
We now support the latest PostgreSQL version 16 and we recommend migrating to this version
by creating a new database instance and manually migrating data over to it.
<br/>
This is to ensure that you are running the latest version with all security and other miscellaneous fixes.
<br/>
<br/>
Example migration:
<br/>
Request additional database quota if needed for migration
<br/>
First take a dump of the data (Follow this process for each database on your instance).
<pre>pg_dump -h {{ database.hostname }} -U DB_USERNAME -d DB_NAME > DB_NAME.sql</pre>
<br/>
Create new PostgreSQL 16 <a href="https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/database/02-database-launch">instance</a> and <a href="https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/database/05-database-user">create users, databases and access</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Upload dump to new DB instance
<pre>psql DB_NAME < DB_NAME.sql</pre>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>This needs to be completed by {{ start }}</b>. If you cannot migrate by this date, please reply to this email ASAP.
