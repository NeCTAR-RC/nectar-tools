Dear Project Managers and Members,
<br />
<br />
We hope that you have found the NeCTAR Research Cloud helpful in your research.
<br />
<br />
Project allocations on the Research Cloud are created for a fixed term to ensure fair access to resources for all users of the cloud.
<br />
<br />
Your project allocation, {{ project.name }}, is <b>due to expire on {{ expiry_date }}.</b>
<br />
<br />
<b>If you wish to continue using the Research Cloud</b> for your research please submit an extension request for your project allocation by following the steps below:
<br />
<ol>
<li>Log in to the <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au">Nectar dashboard</a></li>
<li>Navigate to "Allocations -> My Requests" and click the "Amend/Extend allocation" button on the right, next to your project.</li>
On the Request Form, you are asked to fill in or adjust some details about your research project. Please review this carefully, as some questions may have changed since your previous application.</li>
<li>Click the "Submit" button.</li>
</ol>
<br />
<b>If you no longer require your allocation</b> please help us out by shutting down your instances and deleting your data prior to expiry of your allocation.
<br />
<br />
We want to ensure that researchers like you have as much access as possible to the Research Cloud, but we need to ensure that any allocated resources are being actively used as the available resources are limited.
<br />
<br />
If you have not submitted a project allocation extension request, on the project expiry date the quota for your project allocation will be set to zero. This means existing virtual machines and storage resources will continue to be accessible, but no new virtual machines or cloud storage can be used.  At 1 month after expiry, our system will terminate and archive any instances and data in this project allocation, releasing the resources for other users of the cloud. The archived instances and data will be safely stored, and will remain available to you for 3 months from the date when the project expires. However after this time they will be deleted.
<br />

Please log a ticket at support.ehelp.edu.au if you have any questions or concerns.

<br />
Thanks,
<br />
NeCTAR Research Cloud Team
