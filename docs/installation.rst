Installation
============

* Install virtualenv if you do not have it installed already. You can use your
  package manager or pip. For Ubuntu and Fedora, the package is called
  python-virtualenv. Instructions for using pip are at
  https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html
* Create a virtualenv and activate it::

  $ mkvirtualenv nectar_tools

* Clone this repository::

  $ git clone https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectar-tools.git

* Install the nectar_tools package into your virtual environment. This will
  ensure that all the necessary dependencies are also installed into this
  environment::

   $ pip install nectar_tools
