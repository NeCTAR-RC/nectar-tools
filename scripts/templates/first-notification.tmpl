Dear NeCTAR Research Cloud User,


We hope that you have found the NeCTAR Research Cloud (NRC) helpful in your research.

Projects on the NRC are created for a fixed term to ensure fair access to resources for all users of the cloud.

This is just a heads up on your trial project, {{ project_name }}, is over 80% of allowed cloud usage. That
is just under a period of 3 months which was given to you at the start of your cloud trial.

Once the quota reaches 100% (3 months usage) our system will notify you again and set your project's quota to 0.
The instances within the project will remain active, however you won't be able
to launch any new instances.

If you reach 120%, our system will shut down and archive any instances in this
trial project releasing the resources for other users of the cloud. The archived
instances will be safely stored, and will remain available to you for 3 months
from the date when the project was closed.

If you wish to continue using the NRC for your research please submit an
allocation request; see http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/docs/allocations for
details on how to access further resources on the NRC.

If you are thinking of putting in an application for use of further NRC
resources, please let us know so we can help you smoothly transition your
research onto a new project allocation.

Please reply to this email if you have any questions or concerns.


Thanks,

NeCTAR Research Cloud Team
