Dear Sir/Madam,

We hope that you have found the NeCTAR Research Cloud (NRC) helpful in your research.

Projects on the NRC are created for a fixed term to ensure fair access to resources for all users of the cloud.

Your trial project, {{ project_name }}, is due to expire on {{ expiry_date }}.
On the expiry date, our system will shut down and archive any instances in this
trial project releasing the resources for other users of the cloud. The archived
instances will be safely stored, and will remain available to you for 3 months
from the date when the project was closed.
 
We want to ensure that researchers like you have as much access as possible to the NRC,
but we need to ensure that any allocated resources are actually being used, since the available resources are limited.
 
If you wish to continue using the NRC for your research please submit an
allocation request; see http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/allocations.html for
details on how to access further resources on the NRC.
 
If you are thinking of putting in an application for use of further NRC
resources, please let us know so we can help you smoothly transition your
research onto a new project allocation.
 
Please reply to this email if you have any questions or concerns.


Thanks,

NeCTAR Research Cloud Team
