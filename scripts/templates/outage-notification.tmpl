Dear NeCTAR Research Cloud User,

This email is to inform you of a scheduled outage to the NeCTAR Research Cloud.

DURATION:   24 hours
START TIME: 09:00 AEST Tue Apr 29th 2014
END TIME:   09:00 AEST Wed Apr 30th 2014

DESCRIPTION:

A 24 hour outage is required to relocate and upgrade the cloud storage
infrastructure at the University of Melbourne. Only instances in the
{{ zone }} availability zone will be affected. The upgrade will bring
further stability and increased performance to this availability zone.

IMPACT:

All instances in the {{ zone }} availability zone will be shut down
and will be inaccessible during the outage. Instances will NOT be destroyed,
only shut down. This zone will be offline during the outage period and no
requests to the zone will be processed. Users have the option of relocating
instances to other availability zones prior to the outage. At present there is
reasonable spare capacity across the cloud to start instances elsewhere,
however this capacity may decrease as the outage date approaches.

{% if affected -%}
Your current instances in the {{ zone }} zone are listed below.

{% endif -%}

ACTION REQUIRED:

 * It is recommended that users complete their own backups, snapshots or
   otherwise copy data to somewhere other than the {{ zone }} zone

 * Once backups are complete, it is recommended that users detach volumes and
   shut down their own instances. If a user is unable to do so, the instances
   will be shut down at the outage start time

 * Ensure that the above items are completed well in advance of the outage
   start time

 * After the outage, users will be required to restart their own instances

{% if affected -%}
AFFECTED INSTANCES:

UUID                                  IP Address      Host            Project
{% for project, servers in instances.iteritems() -%}
{% for server in servers -%}
{{ server.id }}  {{ server.accessIPv4 }}  {{ server.name }}      {{ project }}
{% endfor -%}
{% endfor -%}
{% endif %}
