Dear Research Cloud User,

This email is to inform you of a scheduled outage to the NeCTAR Research Cloud.

DURATION:   24 hours
START TIME: 09:00 AEST Tue April 28th 2014
END TIME:   09:00 AEST Wed April 29th 2014

DESCRIPTION:

A 24 hour outage is required to relocate and upgrade the cloud storage
infrastructure at the University of Melbourne. Only instances in the
{{ target_zone }} availability zone will be affected. The upgrade will bring
further stability and increased performance to this availability zone.

IMPACT:

All instances in the {{ target_zone }} availability zone will be shut down and
will be inaccessible during the outage. Your current instances are listed
below.

You have the option of relocating your instance to other availability zones
prior to the outage. At present there is reasonable spare capacity across
the cloud to start instances elsewhere, however this capacity may decrease
as the outage date approaches.

Before the outage:

* Complete your own backups, snapshots or otherwise copy data to
somewhere other than the {{ target_zone }} zone
* Once backups are complete, users are encouraged to detach volumes
and to shut down their own instance(s)
* If you are unable to shut down your instance(s), they will be shut down
at the outage start time
* Ensure that they above items are completed well in advance of the
outage start time


Your Affected instances:
========================

{% for instance in instances -%}
