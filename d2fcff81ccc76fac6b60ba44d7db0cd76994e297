      "message": "This should go in the else of an except:\n\n\nThe try … except statement has an optional else clause, which, when present, must follow all except clauses. It is useful for code that must be executed if the try clause does not raise an exception. For example:\n\nfor arg in sys.argv[1:]:\n    try:\n        f \u003d open(arg, \u0027r\u0027)\n    except OSError:\n        print(\u0027cannot open\u0027, arg)\n    else:\n        print(arg, \u0027has\u0027, len(f.readlines()), \u0027lines\u0027)\n        f.close()\n\nThe use of the else clause is better than adding additional code to the try clause because it avoids accidentally catching an exception that wasn’t raised by the code being protected by the try … except statement.",
